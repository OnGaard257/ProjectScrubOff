This is a fighting game where characters fight one another, not to defeat them in combat, but to clean their opponent. Both players are covered in dirt and the first player to clean their opponent wins the fight.
Player 1's controls are the A and D keys to move left and right, the W key to jump, and spacebar to attack.
Player 2's controls are the left and right arrow keys to move left and right, the up key to jump, and the down key to attack.
